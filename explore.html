                        <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
                        <p>
                          Manual sampling and laboratory analysis are the traditional methods for monitoring soil 
                          conditions and nutrient levels, but they can be time-consuming and expensive, and may not give 
                          real-time data. Agricultural settings require accurate and timely information about soil conditions 
                          and nutrient levels, which is a challenge with soil conditions and nutrient monitoring. Farmers who are 
                          unable to obtain the weather details may face losses in farming, which is why it is crucial to understand
                           weather forecasting in a timely manner. Farmers should obtain adequate information about soil and crop
                            details to enhance crop productivity.We are working to address some of the challenges farmers encounter.

                        <h3>Our Idea</h3>
                        <p>
                          Developing and deploying low-cost, low-power, quicker, and real-time soil conditions and nutrients monitoring systems in farm lands 
                          For this, sensor nodes are developed by incorporating major soil nutrients and conditions sensors and ESP-32. This embedded system 
                          uploads the soil nutrients and conditions data to the IoT cloud over Wi-Fi protocol.
                           The data from the cloud is fetched using an API, and using JavaScript, the data is analysed and displayed on our website.</p>
                        <h3>Our Technology</h3>
                        <p>
                          Our proposed solution will help the farmer in all aspects, including monitoring nutrients and soil conditions. 
                          The data obtained from the monitoring system will be archived on a cloud server for evaluation. 
                          The main goal is to keep track of the level of nutrients in the soil. Various sensors will be used to 
                          monitor parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, temperature, and pH value in our proposed system.
                           Farmers will be able to accurately plan cultivation by knowing their soil before starting farming. The sensor data
                            has been incorporated into our website. The soil analysis feature on our website allows for the display of results
                             for various parameters and the visualization of the analyzed data. There is also a section designed to educate farmers.
                              Details about the importance of these parameters are provided in that section, and we will also provide 
                          crop information to enhance productivity. The forecasting section is where they will receive the five-day weather forecast in advance.
