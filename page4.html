                        <h3>Soil Temperature</h3>
                        <p>
                            Soil temperature refers to the measurement of the ground’s inherent warmth. It controls the chemistry and biology of the ground and the atmospheric-ground gas exchange. You may also encounter the term “soil surface temperature,” which is the measurement of warmth/coldness in the 

                            top 4 inches (10 cm) of the ground. Seasonal and daily changes in the land’s warmth degrees may cause variations in radiant energy and energy shifts at the ground surface.
                            The importance of soil temperature in agriculture is due to its impact on the effectiveness of many farming procedures. The soil solarization process relies on the ground’s warmth and moisture levels. The success of fertilizing and weed management also heavily depends on the ground’s thermal conditions.
                            
                            The ground’s warmth affects various plant processes, such as nutrient and water uptake and root growth. It has also been shown that nitrogen uptake varies both in quantity and form depending on the thermal conditions of the ground . Therefore, the ground’s temperature is even more influential on plant growth than air warmth.
                            
                </p> 
                <h3>Effects Of Soil Temperature On Plant Growth</h3>
                        <p>
                            The influence of soil temperature on plant growth is related to the fact that warmth promotes crop development through increased water and nutrient uptake, while cold inhibits water uptake due to lower water viscosity and slows down the process of photosynthesis.
Furthermore, a lack of warmth is unfavorable for earth-dwelling microorganisms since their metabolism slows down, leading to less nutrient release and less nutrient dissolution. Thereby, plant growth is stunted in colder climates. As for shoot growth, the cold ground and air are slowing it down because of inhibited cell duplication.
It affects the speed and thoroughness of root system development, including the roots’ initiation and branching, orientation, turnover, and 

growth direction. As the ground warms down, plant roots can easily reach those warmer areas .
Even though the warmer ground is beneficial for root development, excessive heat reduces land quality by speeding up the decomposition of 

organic matter and the evaporation of moisture. So it’s crucial to keep the ground at an optimal level of warmth for healthy plant growth.

                <h3>Impact Of Soil Temperature On Soil Properties
                    <p>The ground’s thermal conditions can either decrease or increase the biological, chemical, and physical characteristics of various types of soil. To effectively control thermal conditions in light of your objectives, you must have a firm grasp of these influences on the following properties.</p>
                     </p>
                     <h3>
                        Biological Properties
                     </h3>
                     <p>
                        The average soil temperatures for bioactivity range from 50 to 75°F (10-24°C). These values are favorable for the normal life functions of the ground biota that ensure proper organic matter decomposition, increased nitrogen mineralization, uptake of soluble substances, and metabolism. On the contrary, conditions near freezing slow down the activities of soil-dwelling microorganisms, while macroorganisms can’t survive below freezing points. Decreased microbial activities are the reason for reduced organic matter decomposition and its excessive accumulation.

                     </p>
                    <h3>Chemical Properties</h3><p>
                        Due to decomposed organic matter, high soil temperature regimes show higher cation exchange capacity. The warmer the ground, the more 

                        water-soluble phosphorus it contains for plants. Vice versa, low-heated earth is poor in phosphorus available for vegetation. As to pH levels, the acidity rises to a greater degree due to organic acid denaturation</p>
                    <h3>Physical Properties
                    </h3><p>
                        Increased soil temperatures induce the dehydration of clay and cracking of sand particles, eventually reducing their content and increasing the concentration of silt. The warmer the earth is, the more carbon dioxide it releases. Heat is the reason for land cracking due to evaporation and, thus, insufficient water penetration into the ground profile
