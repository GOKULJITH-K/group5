                        Soil health and Crop productivity is one of the main issues in agriculture as it may lead to unhealthy environment. This is mainly caused by the use of excessive fertilizers in the
                        
                        soil. Hence, soil testing should be done before starting agriculture. A soil test is
                        
                        important for several reasons: to optimize crop production, to protect the environment from contamination by runoff and leaching of excess fertilizers, to aid in the
                        
                        diagnosis of plant culture problems, to improve the nutritional balance of the growing media and to save money and conserve energy by applying only the amount of
                        
                        fertilizer needed.
                        
                        Our proposed solution will help a farmer in all aspects, which involves Soil conditions and nutrients monitoring. The data
collected from the monitoring station will be stored in a cloud server for analysis.
                        The main purpose is to monitor the level of nutrients in the soil. Also our proposed system will monitor the 
                        parameters like temperature, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH value using various sensors. This will help a farmer to know his soil before starting farming and
                        precisely plan cultivation.

                    The use of cloud-based technology for soil conditions and nutrients monitoring has numerous benefits. Cloud-based technology allows for real time monitoring and data analysis, which can help farmers make more informed decisions
                    about fertilization and irrigation. It can also help reduce costs and increase yields by
                    
                    ensuring that crops are getting the right amount of nutrients and water. Additionally, cloud based technology can provide access to data and insights from multiple sources, which can help farmers make better informed decisions about crop management. Overall, the use of this technology for soil conditions and nutrients monitoring
                    
                    has the potential to revolutionize agriculture and help farmers improve their yields
                    and profitability while also being more environmentally sustainable. Also it can
                    improve communication and collaboration between farmers, researchers, and other
                    
                    stakeholders in the agricultural industry. Also it can enhance sustainability in agriculture by reducing the environmental impact of farming practices. In conclusion,
                    
                    the use of cloud based technology for soil conditions and nutrients monitoring has
                    the potential to transform the agricultural industry and help farmers achieve greater
                    productivity and sustainability.
